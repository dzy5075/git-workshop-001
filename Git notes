// Git workflow

Rule 1: Never work on the main / master branch

Name your branches like this;
your-name/feature-you-working-on
    cleo/signup-form

do not name branches simply by your name

3.Set the upstream

Point this branch to a remote branch on GitHub so that GH knows to track changes going forward

(GH doesn't know about this branch yet.)

$ git push
